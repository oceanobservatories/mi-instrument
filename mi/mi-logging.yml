# DEFAULT LOGGING CONFIGURATION FOR MARINE INTEGRATION PROJECT
#
# NOTE: this file might not be used!
#       this file is a backup packaged with marine-integrations
#       only in the case res/config/mi-logging.yml is not found.
#       this guarantees the logging will not be completely disabled if the environment is not configured properly.
#
# NOTE: this configuration writes logfiles in the current working directory!
#       if we are using this file at all, we don't know how the environment has been configured and
#       don't want to assume there is a log/ subdirectory.
